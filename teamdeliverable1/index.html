		<h2>Requirement 1</h2>
  
		<h3>Need-</h3>
			<p><a href="http://pathfindercrm.com/" target="_blank">Pathfinder CRM, LLC</a> is a private business, offering Archeological Support and Historic Preservation services in the U.S. and abroad. The website is designed to advance the businesses
			mission, vision, brand and service(s) to core constituents and potential consumers. A secondary purpose is to provide information to the Archeological and Historic Preservation communities
			The current look and feel, structure and flow of the site is in our groups opinions leaving those that would frequent the website left dissatisfied with their overall user experience. We also agreed
			that the way the site is maintained leaves one to wonder if "Pathfinders" is still an active business or if their business has dissolved leaving only the remnants of an old website as an 
			artifact of the business that once existed. Our teams goals for the website redesign are to:</p>
  
		<ul>
			<li>Update:create current look</li>
			<li>Reorganize:add much needed organization to the site's content</li>
			<li>Restructure:add ease of flow to the site's navigation</li>
		</ul>

			<p>Our main focus for overall site redesign is strongly modeled after Archeological Consultants, Inc.. Stark Preservation's site helped us gain an better general
			understanding of the industry Pathfinder CRM, LLC is a part of and the level of order and organization required to best communicate to our target audience, while the simplicity Archeological Consultants, Inc.
			site fell in line with our vision for how a redesigned Pathfinder CRM, LLC site will appear.</p>
  
			<p>Our team will utilize a few simple tools and technologies to manage our project. The tools and uses are as follows:</p>
  
			<ul>
				<li>Agile Process Management- managing website redesign.</li>
				<li>Canvas- Assignment Requirements, File Sharing, Communication.</li>
				<li>Dunwoody Email- email reminders</li>

			</ul>
  
		<h3>Content-</h3>
			<p>The redesigned website will have a total of 12 pages. The page titles and content breakdown are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Home</li>
				<li>Services</li>
				<li>Staff</li>
				<li>Archeological Support Services</li>
				<li>Historic Preservation</li>
				<li>Where we work</li>

		<h3>Target Audience-</h3>
			<p>General audience data: The general audience seeking the services of Pathfinder CRM, LLC. are researchers and archeology enthusiasts, that place great value on the preservation of history, and its artifacts.</p>
			<p>Our group believes that offering more specific demographics would require us to make direct contact with the business. For the purpose of this assignment, we will not be making any contact with the business.</p>
			<p>Becoming any more specific in the details of the business Target Audience would be limiting to the redesign we are preparing to do, and the goals we are aiming to accomplish. The site in it's current state likely attracts minimal traffic if any. We need to remain very inclusive, if we are to reach our goals.</p>
